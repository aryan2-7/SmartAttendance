## Key decisions made
- LBPH algorithm chosen insted of deep learning as it requrires too many initial images, computational power and is less efficient, our skill level was also considered for this decision
- Liveness detection explicitly descoped — for now, will come back to this if the project is finished early, very complex
- One .yml model file per student (name_roll.yml) — no numeric ID needed in filename
- CASCADE_PATH = `../resources/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`
- MODELS_DIR   = `../resources/trained_models/`
- Paths are relative to `build/` directory (where the executable runs)
- SQLite will use the amalgamation approach (drop-in .c + .h, no brew install)

## Build command (all OS)
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . -j4
```

## What to change in this file (for teamates)
When you finish a module, change the status next to the file structure from ⬜ to ✅ and add a one-line summary of what it does
If any major decision is made, update the relevant section.
